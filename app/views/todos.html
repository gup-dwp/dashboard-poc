       Use this when:

         <li>
           a list of things need to be done

           each thing links to thing that needs to be done

       Research notes
     </h2>

     <p>
       People found the layout easy to use and interact with, especially on mobile. It is important you use verbs for the to-do label so people clearly know what to expect. Whilst people positively responded to doing the to-dos in any order, most naturally completed them top to bottom, so it's important to order them logically for your service. If a to-do can be part-completed, an indication of progress is a must.

    <p>
      Use this when:
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          a list of things need to be done in a single view by multiple users
        </li>
        <li>
          each thing is assigned to one or multiple users
        </li>
        <li>
          each thing needs to have supporting content
        </li>
        <li>
          each thing needs to be completed by a specific date
        </li>
        <li>
          completed things are stored and viewed elsewhere
